# Korean With Hanja (KWH)
Korean With Hanja (KWH) is a full beginner course on the Korean language, but with Hanja from the ground up.

Hanja, the traditional writing system for the Korean language, has increasingly faded into obscurity and obsoletion in the past few decades, especially with the turn of the 21st century. Nowadays, most Korean courses for beginners do not even touch upon the subject of Hanja at all or the preponderance of Sino-Korean vocabulary still present in the modern Korean language. We believe this is highly unfortunate, as even understanding the concept of Hanja at a rudimentary level can be highly beneficial for learning the Korean language and gives one a solid foundation on how to approach and interpret relationships between vocabulary in the wider context of the language.

Korean With Hanja aims to be just like any other beginner Korean course, except that Hanja is introduced from day one and is a core part of the learning process in the course. Korean With Hanja is exclusively taught in Korean mixed script (漢字混用/한자혼용/*hanja honyong*), and the overall look and feel of the Korean language on KWH superficially harkens back to a '70s vibe, yet the language is fully modern and adapted to the lives and context of the 2020s.
